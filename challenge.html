<h2 id = "1.1"><li>Affordances, visual variables and interaction flows</li></h2>
<h3><u>Academic presentation</u></h3>
<ul>
<p><li>Affordance and visual variables:</li></p>
<p><b>Schedule meeting:</b> The presenter can schedule a meeting.</p>
<p><b>Join meeting:</b> Allow people to join a meeting.</p>
<p><b>Screen sharing:</b> The presenter can share their screen and present content.</p>
<p><b>Virtual background:</b> Enables the presenter to employ a virtual background to block out distractions and establish a professional atmosphere.</p>

<p><b>Whiteboard:</b> Enables the speaker to annotate or draw.</p>
<p><b>Chat</b>: Allows attendees to ask questions or make comments.</p>
<p><b>Raise hand:</b> Allows attendees to raise their hand virtually and let the speaker know they have questions.</p>
<p><li>Interaction flow:</li></p>
<p>The speaker provides the material while sharing their screen, then accepts questions at the conclusion. Participants can offer questions in the chat feature or indicate their want to speak by raising their hands.</p>
<p><li>Proposed Approaches:</li></p>
<p>Introduce a tool, like polling or quizzes, that enables the presenter to engage the audience more actively. This can assist in maintaining audience interest and offer a quick response.</p>
</ul>
<br>
<h3><u>Attending meeting at late hours</u></h3>
<ul>
<p><li>Affordance and visual variables:</li></p>
<p><b>Audio and video calls:</b>Attendees can engage in the debate through audio and video calls.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id = "1.2"><li>Metaphors and idioms</li></h2>
<p>Visual metaphors and idioms would not be directly applicable if we used a text-only interface. Instead, functionality and feedback would be given by textual standards. To establish and handle meetings, webinars, and other Zoom resources, for instance, the Zoom API should offer a set of commands.</p>
<h3><u>Metaphors:</u></h3>

<p>Mute/Unmute Button: This is a button in Zoom that allows users to mute or unmute their microphone during a meeting <img src="mic.png" alt="microphone" style="width:3%"> It is usually represented by a microphone icon with a slash through it when muted <img src="notmic.png" alt="notMicrophone" style="width:3%"></p>

<br>
<h3><u>Idioms:</u></h3>
<p>Share screen Button: This button features a square with an arrow oriented up, which represents the idea of sharing your computer screen with others in the meeting <img src="sharescreen.png" alt="arrowup" style="width:5%"></p>
<p>Record Button: This is a button in Zoom that allows users to record a meeting. It is represented by an icon of a white circle with a white dot in the center.</p>
<p>Join meeting Button: A person use this button to join a meeting. It is represented by a square with a plus <img src="join.png" alt="plus" style="width:3%"></p>
<p>Full Screen Button: This is a button in Zoom that allows users to view the meeting in full-screen mode. It is represented by an icon of an arrow pointing outward.</p>
<br>
<h3><u>Textual conventions that could be used in a Zoom CLI:</u></h3>

<h2 id="1.3"><li>Cognitive overload</li></h2>
<h2 id="1.4"><li>Improvements</li></h2>
<ul>
<h2 id="1.4.1"><li>Desktop</li></h2>
<h2 id="1.4.1.1">Problems</h2>
<ol>
<p><li><u>Buttons:</u> Due to the resize window function of the desktop application, certain buttons on the main screen may disappear, requiring several actions to find a button and use it.</li></p>
<p><li><u>Share:</u> When a user wants to share the screen, they have to press quite a large number of buttons to perform this action</li></p>
</ol>
<h2 id="1.4.1.2">Solutions</h2>
<ol>
  <p><li><u>Costumizable order of buttons:</u> The bottom bar that contains all the buttons allows editing according to the user's preferences so that he can choose which buttons are more useful for him and place them in a visible place, especially when the resize window function is also used.</li></p>
  <p><li><u>Share:</u> The desktop and web app could simplify the screen sharing interface by reducing the number of buttons and options.</li></p>
</ol>
<h2 id="1.4.2"><li>Mobile</li></h2>
<h2 id="1.4.2.1">Problems</h2>
<ol>
  <p><li><u>Buttons:</u> For the current version of the application, the buttons used to create or participate in a meeting are not in an easily accessible place.</li></p>
  <p><li><u>Share:</u> When the user uses the mobile application and wants to share the screen, there are many options, including that of sharing files</li></p>
</ol>
<h2 id="1.4.2.2">Solutions</h2>
<ol>
  <p><li><u>Costumizable order of buttons:</u> Just like in the case of the desktop application, all the buttons should have the possibility to be placed wherever the user wants.</li></p>
  <p><li><u>Share:</u> For the share button, there should only be one use to share the screen on the phone and in the chat window there should be buttons only to share some files.</li></p>
</ol>
