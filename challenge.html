</ul>
<h2 id = "1.2"><li>Metaphors and idioms</li></h2>
<p>Visual metaphors and idioms would not be directly applicable if we used a text-only interface. Instead, functionality and feedback would be given by textual standards. To establish and handle meetings, webinars, and other Zoom resources, for instance, the Zoom API should offer a set of commands.</p>

<h2 id="1.3"><li>Cognitive overload</li></h2>
<p>When a user is confronted with too much information or too many alternatives to process, cognitive overload can happen in the Zoom app, which can cause confusion and frustration. This may affect user experience and result in lower engagement and productivity. From a UI/UX point of view, there are several factors that can contribute to cognitive overload in the Zoom app in special conditions or contexts.</p>
<h3><u>General</u></h3>
<p>Users can adjust a wide range of audio and video settings, including camera angle, microphone and speaker volume, and background noise suppression. Customers could struggle to discover the best settings for their needs because of the wide range of possibilities.</p>
<p>Users with disabilities, such as those who have hearing or vision difficulties, may find it difficult to use Zoom or to grasp its auditory or visual indications.</p>
<h3><u>Late hours meeting & Academic presentations</u></h3>
<p>Several windows and controls, including chat, a participants list, and screen sharing, are available to users of Zoom. Those who are inexperienced with the program or who are not used to multitasking may find this to be overwhelming. Also, people with disabilities may find it challenging to operate these windows and controls.</p>
<p>Because there are too many options and buttons, using share screen is frequently complicated.</p>
<h2 id="1.4"><li>Improvements</li></h2>
<ul>
<h2 id="1.4.1"><li>Desktop&Web</li></h2>
<h2 id="1.4.1.1">Problems</h2>
<ol>
<p><li><u>Buttons:</u> Due to the resize window function of the desktop application, certain buttons on the main screen may disappear, requiring several actions to find a button and use it.</li></p>
<p><li><u>Share:</u> When a user wants to share the screen, they have to press quite a large number of buttons to perform this action</li></p>
<p><li><u>Differences between platforms:</u> There are settings on the web that are not available on desktop or mobile</li></p>
</ol>
<h2 id="1.4.1.2">Solutions</h2>
<ol>
  <p><li><u>Costumizable order of buttons:</u> The bottom bar that contains all the buttons allows editing according to the user's preferences so that he can choose which buttons are more useful for him and place them in a visible place, especially when the resize window function is also used.</li></p>
  <p><li><u>Share:</u> The desktop and web app could simplify the screen sharing interface by reducing the number of buttons and options.</li></p>
  <p><li><u>Differences between platforms:</u> Keep both platforms' user flows, settings, and interface designs consistent so that users may simply switch between them without having to relearn how to use the software</li></p>
</ol>
<h2 id="1.4.2"><li>Mobile</li></h2>
<h2 id="1.4.2.1">Problems</h2>
<ol>
  <p><li><u>Buttons:</u> For the current version of the application, the buttons used to create or participate in a meeting are not in an easily accessible place.</li></p>
  <p><li><u>Share:</u> When the user uses the mobile application and wants to share the screen, there are many options, including that of sharing files</li></p>
  <p><li><u>Differences between platforms:</u> There are less settings on the mobile app than on desktop or mobile and it is difficult for someone to get used to without those settings or having to use the web/desktop app at certain times</li></p>
</ol>
<h2 id="1.4.2.2">Solutions</h2>
<ol>
  <p><li><u>Costumizable order of buttons:</u> Just like in the case of the desktop application, all the buttons should have the possibility to be placed wherever the user wants.</li></p>
  <p><li><u>Share:</u> For the share button, there should only be one use to share the screen on the phone and in the chat window there should be buttons only to share some files.</li></p>
  <p><li><u>Differences between platforms:</u> Keep both platforms' user flows, settings, and interface designs consistent so that users may simply switch between them without having to relearn how to use the software.</li></p>
</ol>
</ul>
<h2 id = "1.5"><li>Empiric Laws</li></h2>
<ol>
  <h2 id ="1.5.1"><li>Fitts' Law</li></h2>
  <p>According to Fitts' law, the amount of time needed to reach a target region quickly depends on both the target's size and its distance from the starting point. Fitts' law may still be applicable in the setting of multi-device interaction, where users may engage with several devices at once, but it would need to be improved and modified to take into account the increased complexity of the interaction.</p>
  <br>
  <p>By taking into account the many types of involved devices and their individual input techniques, Fitts' law can be modified to fit the context of multi-device interaction. The size of the target and the distance to it, for instance, may need to be modified if a user is working with a smartphone and a laptop at the same time based on the effective size of each input method, such as the touch screen on a smartphone versus the touchpad or mouse on a laptop.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Joining a meeting, starting or stopping video, sharing screens, and chatting are just a few of the many actions that are involved with Zoom. The frequency and importance of each action should be taken into account when adjusting the size and placement of goals. For instance, buttons for more seldom tasks can be smaller and harder to reach than those for starting or stopping video camera.</p>
  <h2 id ="1.5.2"><li>Hick's Law</li></h2>
  <p>A psychological principle known as Hick's Law defines how long it takes to decide as the number of possibilities grows. This is significant for design since it demonstrates how Hick's Law may be applied to any choice where there are numerous alternatives.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Users might have access to a variety of choices, including joining a meeting, sharing a screen, and muting and unmuting audio. The quantity of alternatives and the kinds of technologies used to access them might affect how long it takes to make a decision. The cognitive load associated with each option and device should be taken into account, if a user needs to choose between several options available on a smartphone and a laptop. For consumers who handle a mobile device in addition to a desktop computer, the Zoom App might offer a streamlined interface with fewer options to help shorten the decision-making process. For example on mobile platform when you want to share your screen there are too many options to choose from.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Some choices could be more important than others. For instance, choosing which virtual background to use may have not immediate repercussions versus determining whether to unmute audio during a meeting. When evaluating the time needed to make a decision, the decision's importance should be taken into account.</p>
<h2 id ="1.5.3">1.5.3. Steering Law</h2>
<p>The Steering Law is an equation that predicts the efficiency of very common interactions; it describes the particular case of path-steering tasks, that is, when a user must move a pointer through a path with boundaries or a “tunnel”.</p>
<br>
<p>To participate in meetings or webinars, users frequently use a combination of devices, such as a computer, smartphone, or tablet. Throughout a Zoom meeting, people might regularly switch between devices. This can make it more difficult for the brain to process information and slow down or aﬀect cursor movement. When switching between devices, the Zoom app can offer visual hints or feedback to minimize cognitive load. As an example, while switching between devices, the cursor might vary in color or shape, serving as a visual cue.</p>
</ol>
<h2 id = "1.6"><li>New Features</li></h2>
<h3><u>Customizable user interface elements</u></h3>
<p>Users may be able to customize the Zoom app interface's look and feel by altering the color scheme or the order in which the different elements are shown. So there can be a button in the settings section to be able to modify the general theme of the application (color/font) as well as the icons (both color and shape, and the order/place of their display depending on the priority chosen by the user). To be able to change the icons in accordance with their priority and frequency of use, a button with the same functionality must also be present in the window of a meeting that is currently in progress. The button below would be located in Setting window and on a meeting screen.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="customize.png" alt="customize" style="width:19%">
</div>
<h3><u>Onboarding experience</u></h3>
<p>When an app is first launched, a user is guided through its main features and functionalities by a series of screens or other interactive elements. The goal of the onboarding process is to provide users a quick understanding of how the app works and how to use it successfully. It might have things like greetings, highlighting particular features, interactive walkthroughs, and advice or hints. The purpose of the onboarding process is to shorten the learning curve for new users and improve their app engagement. However, there should also be a button for users who already have the application but want to go through the onboarding experience again.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="onboard.png" alt="boat" style="width:22%">
</div>
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="onboard-boat.png" alt="onboard-boat" >
  </div>
<h3><u>Subtitles</u></h3>
<p>Some zoom users may not be able to listen to the conversation (they are deaf or just simply can concentrate better by reading something). During a meeting a user can enable subtitles and read the conversation in the meeting. A button can be added in the buttons' tab; this button, when pressed will enable the subtitles for his own window. When a member is speaking, what he/she is saying will be translated in text.  Once the subtitles button is pressed a notification will be sent to all the members in the meeting, making them aware that the subtitles have been activated. The subtitles will be saved in a document and at the end of the meeting, the document will be downloaded to the PC of the user that pressed the subtitles button.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">

<h2 id="2.3">2.3. Cognitive overload</h2>
<h3><u>General</u></h3>
<p> As noticed previously, there are two similar icons for two different buttons: "<i>more options</i>" and "<i>panel options</i>", that have similar functions: to provide more actions. Not only that the existence of both of them at the same time is redundant, but because their icons are similar and there are no labels can end up confusing the user. </p>
<p> Another thing that can overwhelm the users are the presence of buttons presented as both icons at the bottom of the screen and in textual form, at the top of the screen. Filling the screen with options found in numerous places. </p>
<h3><u>Online training</u></h3>
<p> The upfront presence of the apps button is very likely to distract students from paying attention to the trainer, making them want to explore the option. </p>
<h3><u>Family video meeting</u></h3>
<p>Chances are, that in the family there will be old people not very good with technology, they will get easily overwhelmed by the amount of possible actions. Also, the unlabeled icons consists an impediment in finding the family members present in the meeting.</p>

<h2 id="2.4">2.4. Improvements</h2>

<h2 id="2.4.1">2.4.1. Desktop</h2>
<p><font size="4"><u><i>Problem 1</i></u></font></p>
<p><i>Double icon:</i> As discussed formerly, there are two buttons with similar functions and icons, which can overwhelm and confuse the user.</p>
<p><font size="3.5"><b><i>Solution</i></b></font></p>
<p>The two buttons can be merged together. </p>
<p><font size="4"><u><i>Problem 2</i></u></font></p>
<p><i>General cognitive overload:</i> Majority of action listed on the main screen during a meeting are doubled: once on the top, only by text, and once on the bottom, with icons that are, in some cases, labeled</p>
<p><font size="3.5"><b><i>Solution</i></b></font></p>
<p>Get rid of the text and label every action at the bottom. </p>
<p><font size="4"><u><i>Problem 3</i></u></font></p>
<p><i>End/ Leave meeting button:</i> The icon is confusing as there is no label and it is not clear what it closes.</p>
<p><font size="3.5"><b><i>Solution</i></b></font></p>
<p>Either add the label underneath, or make the button longer and add the label next to it. </p>
<br>
<h2 id="2.4.2">2.4.2. Web</h2>
<p><font size="4"><u><i>Problem 1</i></u></font></p>
<p><i>Triple icon:</i> Similar to the problem from the desktop application, but this time, three buttons with similar functions and similar icons.</p>
<p><font size="3.5"><b><i>Solution</i></b></font></p>
<p>The solution is the same: the buttons can be merged together. Or split the buttons and make the options individual.</p>
<p><font size="4"><u><i>Problem 2</i></u></font></p>
<p><i>Lack of record button:</i> In the web application you can't record the meeting.</p>
<p><font size="3.5"><b><i>Solution</i></b></font></p>
<p>Add the record button (at least as a option to in the panel).</p>
<p><font size="4"><u><i>Problem 3</i></u></font></p>
<p><i>Polling option:</i> Contrary to the last problem, webex provides the option in web to create a poll, but it forces you to move to the desktop application.</p>
<p><font size="3.5"><b><i>Solution</i></b></font></p>
<p>Make the action possible from the web, or take down the button. </p>

<h2 id = "2.5">2.5. Empiric Laws</h2>
<p>The empirical laws of Fitts', Hick's, and Steering have traditionally been applied to the design and evaluation of single-device interactions, such as pointing and clicking on a desktop computer. However, with the rise of multi-device interaction, these laws may need to be reconsidered and adapted to the context of Webex, a popular web conferencing platform.</p>
<h2 id ="2.5.1">2.5.1. Fitts' Law</h2>
<p>When using multiple devices, the distance between devices and the size of the devices may impact the time required to complete a task. For example, if a user needs to switch from a laptop to a smartphone to attend a meeting on Webex, the time required to switch devices and the size of the devices may affect the user's performance. Designers should consider the distance between devices and their size while designing multi-device interactions on Webex by adding a shortcut, such as a QR code that gives the user the same role from the desktop app.</p>
<h2 id ="2.5.2">2.5.2. Hick's Law</h2>
<p>The number and type of options available on each device can affect the time required to complete a task when using multiple devices. For instance, when attending a meeting on Webex using a laptop and a smartphone, the different options available on each device, such as touch screen gestures on the smartphone and keyboard shortcuts on the laptop, can impact the user's decision-making and task performance. Therefore, designers should take into account the number and type of options available on each device when designing multi-device interactions on Webex when providing different options. For instance, on a phone, only the bare minimum should be upfront, anything else should be hidden in menus.</p>
<h2 id ="5.3">2.5.2. Steering Law</h2>
<p>The time required to complete a task when using multiple devices can be affected by the speed and curvature of interactions across devices. For instance, if a user needs to navigate through multiple screens or interfaces on Webex using different devices, the speed and curvature of these interactions can impact their performance. Therefore, when designing multi-device interactions on Webex, designers should take into account the speed and curvature of interactions across devices. To scroll down necessitates more effort on a smartphone, than on desktop, where you only need to press a button. </p>
<h2 id = "2.6">2.6. New Features</h2>
<h3><u>Transcription</u></h3>
<p> This would consist in a small text at the bottom of the screen, transcribing the speech of everyone involved, with the name of the speaker before. </p>
<p>A possible icon is:</p>
<center><img src="webex_transcription.png" alt="webex_transcription" style="width: 20%"></center> 
<p> And it should be positioned on the bottom bar during a meeting. </p>
<p> A more extensive preview of the integration:</p>
<div><center><img src="webex_bar_with_transcript.png"></center></div>
<h3><u>Subtitles</u></h3>
<p> Similar to the previous feature, this function would display a small text at the bottom of the screen. However, instead of transcribing the speech, it would show the translation of the speech in a previously chosen language, along with the name of the speaker. </p>
<p>A possible icon is:</p>
<center><img src="webex_subtitle_black.png" alt="webex_subtitle_black" style="width: 20%"></center>
<p> And it should be positioned on the bottom bar during a meeting.</p>
<p> A more extensive preview of the integration:</p>
<div><center><img src="webex_bar_with_subtitle.png"></center> </div>
<br>
<p>If both the feature are implemented, they should be grouped, resulting in:</p>
<div><center><img src="webex_bar_transcrit+subtitles.png" alt="webex_bar_transcript+subtitles"></center></div>
<h3><u>Personalization</u></h3>
<p>This feature would provide users with a wider range of customization options, giving them the ability to alter the color theme, icon style, and font style according to their preferences. </p>
<p>A possible icon is: </p>
<center><img src="webex_themes.png" alt="webex_customize" style="width: 20%"> </center>
<p> And it should be positioned on the header during a meeting and in general settings page accessible from the main one.</p>
<p> A more extensive preview of the integration:</p>
<div><center><img src="webex_top_bar_customize.png"> </center></div>
